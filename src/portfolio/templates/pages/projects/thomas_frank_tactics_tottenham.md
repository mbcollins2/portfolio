As a [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/) fan, I found myself wanting to learn more about the tactics of [newly appointed manager](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2025/june/thomas-frank-joins-as-head-coach/) Thomas Frank. This project is an analysis of how Thomas Frank has set up Brentford during his time as their manager in the Premier League.

We'll begin with the analysis itself, and then go into so of the technical components of how the analysis was completed at the end.

## Initial Proof of Concept
Before getting deep into an analysis, I first wanted to confirm if there was enough variance in Thomas Franks tactics to make further exploration worthwhile.

TODO - show some basic group bys and counts of formations used
